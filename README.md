# HueWind

This is an app for quickly generating a theme for Tailwind CSS. It uses cubic interpolation to create a swatch of colors that cohesively blends between your light value, a chosen primary color, and a dark value. It also determines a tetrad of complementary colors to make generation of a full theme quick and easy.
